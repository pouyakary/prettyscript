-// These tests ensure that in cases where it may *appear* that a value has a type,
-// they actually are properly being contextually typed. The way we test this is
-// that we invoke contextually typed arguments with type arguments.
-// Since 'any' cannot be invoked with type arguments, we should get errors
-// back if contextual typing is not taking effect.
